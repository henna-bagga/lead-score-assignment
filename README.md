To achieve this, a logistic regression model is to be built to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher lead score will mean higher chance of lead converting to paying customers and a lower lead score will mean cold lead and low chances of lead conversion.
